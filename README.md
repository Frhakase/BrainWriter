This is a collection of code for the BrainWriter project. Currently, it's just the ofxOpenBCI OpenFrameworks add-on and a testing app (in development), but there will also be the data server and associated webpage coming soon.

The Betamaker OpenFrameworks project is for eliciting beta waves and storing the data in a way that can be used down the road

Detailed instructions for working with the ofxOpenBCI addon can be found in the Readme in the ofxOpenBCI/ folder
